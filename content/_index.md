### ABOUT


*****************
*****************

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing - UCL, and interested in using statistical methods to understand factors influencing brain health and pathology **:computer: :brain:**.

I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience - Kingâ€™s College London (Supervisors: [Dr Petroula Proitsi](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/petroula.proitsi.html) and [Professor Marcus Richards](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mental-health/people/professor-marcus-richards); Funders: [NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre PhD student](https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/). My PhD work explored relationships between blood metabolites and dementia-related phenotypes using cohort studies, polygenic scores, and Mendelian Randomisation. 

I was successful in applying for an [Enrichment scholarship at the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment); here, I contributed to several projects, upskilling in working with Electronic Health Record data, machine learning methods, and open science. I have an interest in contributing to the University community, and regularly ran seminars for BSc and MSc courses throughout my PhD.
