### ABOUT

*****************

* I am an epidemiologist with a strong background in data science, highly motivated by improving the health of the public.

* I am currently a Principal Scientist (Epidemiology) at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and an Honorary Research Fellow in Epidemiology at the [MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cardiovascular/research/population-science-and-experimental-medicine/mrc-unit-lifelong-health-and-ageing-ucl) (UCL).

* My work history spans academia, the [NHS (NIHR Clinical Research Network)](https://local.nihr.ac.uk/lcrn/west-of-england/), [The Alan Turing Institute](https://local.nihr.ac.uk/lcrn/west-of-england/), and [science writing/editing](https://jobs.cactusglobal.com/current-openings/freelance-specialist-editors). I have regularly taught workshops and University modules, including as lead for a 4-week `Big Data in Python` module.
