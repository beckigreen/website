### ABOUT


*****************
*****************

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing - UCL, interested in using statistical methods to better understand factors influencing health and disease  **:computer **. In my present role, I am investigating risk factors and consequences of common infections using population-based studies and electronic health record data. 

I am experienced in working with highly complex data and proficient in multiple coding languages (R, Python, SQL, bash). I enjoy contributing to the research community; I  have taught at workshops and Unviversity modules regularly for four years, including as lead for a 4-week BSc Python module. In addition to academia, my work history spans the NHS (Clinical Research Network), the Alan Turing Institute, and science writing/editing.

I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience - Kingâ€™s College London (Supervisors: Dr Petroula Proitsi and Professor Marcus Richards; Funders: [NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre](https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/)). During this, I was successful in applying for an [Enrichment scholarship](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment) at the Alan Turing Institute where I upskilled in data science and software engineering.
