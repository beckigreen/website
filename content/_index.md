### ABOUT


*****************
*****************

Bio:
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing - UCL, interested in using statistical methods to better understand factors influencing health and disease  **:computer **. In my present role, I am investigating risk factors and consequences of common infections using population-based studies and electronic health record data. I am experienced in working with highly complex data and proficient in multiple coding languages (R, Python, SQL, bash). I enjoy contributing to the research community; I  have taught at workshops and Unviversity modules regularly for four years, including as lead for a 4-week BSc Python module. In addition to academia, my work history spans the NHS (Clinical Research Network), the Alan Turing Institute, and science writing/editing.

PhD work:
I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience - Kingâ€™s College London (Supervisors: [Dr Petroula Proitsi](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/petroula.proitsi.html) and [Professor Marcus Richards](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mental-health/people/professor-marcus-richards); Funders: [NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre](https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/)). My PhD work explored relationships between blood metabolites and dementia-related phenotypes using cohort studies, polygenic scores, and Mendelian Randomisation. 

I was successful in applying for an [Enrichment scholarship at the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment); here, I contributed to several projects, upskilling in working with Electronic Health Record data, machine learning methods, and open science.
